# House-Price-Prediction

I created this notebook in order to learn advanced regression technique on a kaggle competition.
I have used various data cleaning and managing techniques to get the data fit into the model, also done feature engineering on various categorical variables.
I have also used Seaborn for data visualizations.
The model i used was a X-treme gradient Boosted regressor model by library XGboost.
This also landed me on leaderboard.
